# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repo uses a single-context domain docs layout:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for project domain language.
- `docs/adr/` at the repo root for architectural decisions.

If this becomes a monorepo or develops multiple bounded contexts later, switch to a multi-context layout by adding `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root and updating this file.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/
|   `-- adr/
|       |-- 0001-example-decision.md
|       `-- 0002-example-decision.md
`-- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, or a test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use, or there's a real gap to note for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) - but worth reopening because..._
